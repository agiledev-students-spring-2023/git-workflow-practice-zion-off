## [Could an A.I. Chatbot Rewrite My Novel?](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/could-an-ai-chatbot-rewrite-my-novel)

I wanted to use this article in my exercise because it is so relevant -- Chat GPT is so prevalent that we've even talked about it in class. It has been the talk of the town for a few months now but I don't think most people, myself included, understand what Chat GPT really is. I know a lot of students who use it as a crutch for schoolwork -- to write critical responses, to come up with essay outlines, to solve problems -- and almost everyone seems to be pretty satisfied with the results.

__But how far can Chat GPT really take you?__

I feel like this article got it pretty right. This quote sums up its creative limitations pretty well:

> After a couple months of digging around, it became clear to me that I wasn’t going to find much backing for my plan. One of the computer-science students, as I recall, accused me of trying to strip everything good, original, and beautiful from the creative process. Bots, he argued, could imitate basic writing and would improve at that task, but A.I. could never tell you the way Karenin smiled, nor would it ever fixate on all the place names that filled Proust’s childhood. I understood why he felt that way, and agreed to a certain extent. But I didn’t see why a bot couldn’t just fill in all the parts where someone walks from point A to point B.

I suppose it is a glorified regurgitator at best. Chat GPT can probably take off some poor administrative worker's load, but it is still a long way from **creating** anything **human**.
